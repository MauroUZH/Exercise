# Part 2
```{r}
set.seed(20)
Sample <- rlnorm(n=100,meanlog =1,sdlog=0.25)
hist(Sample, main = "Histogram of a Log Normal Distribution")
hist(log(Sample), main = "Histogram of a Log Normal Distribution on the log scale")
mu <- mean(Sample)
var <- var(Sample)
```

I sample a Log Normal Distribution with 100 observations, a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 0.25. Then I plot a histogram of this sample aswell as the log of the sample.

$\mu$ of the Sample = 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
mu
```



$\sigma^2$ of the Sample = 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
var
```
